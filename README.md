# Robot Process Automation

## Introduction

RPA is a specialised type of automation that mimic the human actions by
interacting with digital systems and software. RPA can be used to
automate tedious repetitive human tasks saving a huge amount of human
effort and time.

RPAs are becoming more and more popular as a means to automate
repetitive tasks in organizations. These automations are largely
beneficial for corporates and organisations. However, there has been a
recent growth in interest for these tools among general audience. Since
we all are engaging with computer one way or another, we all end up
doing some kind of repetitive boring task, be it organising files,
sending mails, fetching some information from the internet on regular
intervals or even something as simple as copy pasting something... All
these tasks can be automated one way or another.

Depending on the medium being used there are multiple free and paid
tools available in the market such as Tasker for Android smartphone, For
windows PC, Microsoft's Powerautomate (*formerly Winautomation*),
UiPath, Robotask, Vtaskstudio etc\... are available.

## Project Objective

Personally, I also have interest in learning about these tools and do
experiments and build small utilities for personal use from time to
time. In this repository I am going to post such small utilities that I
have created for specific tasks that will take too much time if I were
to do it manually.

Each utility will have a specific folder and with its own details
published in its own Readme file.
